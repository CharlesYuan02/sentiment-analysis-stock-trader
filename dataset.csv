It's not like AWS/advertising/twitch are shrinking what they do.",2023-03-20 11:56:18
7269,AMZN,"The memo (also included in the article):

As we’ve just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (“OP2”) this past week, I’m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks—mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.
Let me share some additional context.
As part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole. 
As our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don’t have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we’ve prioritized allocating more resources).
Some may ask why we didn’t announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we’ve made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.
If I go back to our tenet—being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole—I believe the result of this year’s planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we’re investing.
To those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It’s never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.

7274,FIS,"Matt Levine 

Banking is a confidence trick. You put money in the bank today because you are confident you can take it out tomorrow; to you, a dollar that you have deposited in the bank is just as good — just as much money — as a dollar bill in your wallet. If you show up at the ATM at any time of day or night, you expect it to give you your dollars. But the bank doesn’t just put your dollars in a box and wait for you to take them out; the bank uses its depositors’ money to make loans or buy bonds, and just keeps a little bit around for people who need cash. If everyone asked for their money back tomorrow, the bank wouldn’t have it. But everyone is confident that, if they ask for their money back tomorrow, the bank will have it. So they mostly don’t ask for it, so when they do, the bank does have it. The widespread belief that banks have the money is what makes it true.

If people stop believing it, it stops being true. If everyone stops believing in a bank, they will all rush to get their money out, and the bank won’t have it, and their lack of belief will be retrospectively justified. Whereas if they had kept believing, their belief would also have been justified.",2023-03-20 00:52:52

7321,INTC,"I don’t own both but I have thought about buy both at some point. With that said,

NVIDIA is too expansive for me while INTEL is really great at dropping the ball on a consistent basis while just going through the motions. INTEL has this “ oh well” attitude while AMD dominating them.

NVIDIA is a safe play but I wouldn’t take INTEL if I got it for free.  Micron and AMD are safe but they are not in AI like NVDA. ( I don’t own any of these stocks I’ve mentioned).

Fwiw, I dont really care for this new fad of AI stocks and you probably know more about it than I. If you really interested, I’d wait for the buzz to die down so the prices can settle down too.",2023-03-18 16:29:05

7325,PTC,"this is not a surprise. it's pretty much the outcome of SVB going tits up. it's not really a domino effect....it's just, like if you're depending on paying your mortgage with money buried out back, and a dog digs up and steals the money, you're going to get foreclosed on.",2023-03-17 14:10:13
7326,PTC,"Anyone know where customers of SVB will go to next to get funding ? 

It sounds like they were reckless in just trying to get as much business as possible with their lending strategies. 

I wonder what incentives they were offering tech startups that no other banks could. Maybe a bigger cut if the start ups were successful? Idk",2023-03-17 13:13:15

7328,PTC,The parent company wasn't that much more than the bank. Little more than an administrative thing where some auxiliary operations would be held in a separate entity. Basically I think they had something called SVB Securities which was an investment bank that would invest in start-ups on the condition they hold their money in SVB. Most Banks do this where they have a slightly different entity to do different things to deal with differing regulations for differing operations.,2023-03-17 14:13:48

7333,PTC,"So what happens when the FDIC insurance fund runs out? From my understanding, the banks (who take part in the plan) pay premiums into it as an emergency bailout fund. Some banks are not FDIC insured because they don't pay into the fund. Credit unions have their own fund. So if the losses and bank runs exceed the available capital in the insurance fund, what then?",2023-03-17 15:20:12
