Additionally, the P/E ratio alone may not be enough to provide a complete picture of a stock's valuation or prospects for growth. Other factors, such as earnings growth, industry trends, and economic conditions, should also be considered when evaluating a stock's potential for investment.

If they bothered to report the entire memo, they are cutting back on RSUs and increasing base pay. Employees’ compensation has taken a bit because of the stock price sinking so employees are asking the company to reduce RSU share of the compensation and increase base pay.

For anyone who didn’t know, until recently, amazon paid a maximum of $180k USD base pay across the entire company. Even if you were a VP that made $2 mil a year, your compensation would be $180k base and 1.8 mil in stocks. This worked great and people were happy when stock price was going up all the time.
